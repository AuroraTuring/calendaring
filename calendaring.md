1. What times will you dedicate to pre-teaching the upcoming lesson?
Between 6pm - 8pm the day before each lesson. 

2. What times will you dedicate to reviewing lessons?
After my 4pm dinner break, so between 5pm - 8pm weekdays. 

3. What time will you dedicate to project work time? (Sometimes you will have time during class hours to work on projects.)
Any hours I have available, primarily between 4pm - 10pm weekdays and anytime on weekends. 

4. What time are you carving out for your own mental and emotional health needs?
I'm keeping my evenings open after 9pm/10pm to have some down time. I'm also giving myself an hour dinner break right after class to eat and decompress from the busy school day. 

5. How will you spend your weekends?
I will have at least 5-8 hours of study time worked into the weekend as a whole. I will use the weekend for social time (if I have the time), like watching TV with friends, phone calls, and going out places.
